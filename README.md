Inflector.vim
=============

This might at some point become a plugin, right now it's just a little project
to learn vimscript.

The idea is to have a set of functions that present similar functionality as
ActiveSupport::Inflector and make it easier to go from something like 'some_var'
to 'SOME_VAR' or 'SomeVar' to 'some_var', etc.
